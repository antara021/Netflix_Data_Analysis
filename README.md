# Netflix Data Analysis

IS 525 - Data Warehousing and Business Intelligence Final Project:

OBJECTIVE:

Our project's goal was to take a deep dive into various aspects of Netflix such as the number of movies and TV shows available in different countries, their popularity, ratings, revenues, and subscription costs, and understanding user feedback and behavior based on that so that Netflix can identify pain points in the user experience and improve their content quality and platform.
